## Metrics to keep in mind 

### FID (Fréchet Inception Distance)
FID measures how close generated images are to real images by comparing their feature distributions extracted from an Inception network. It models both as Gaussians and computes the Fréchet distance between their means and covariances—lower is better.

### IS (Inception Score)
IS evaluates image quality and diversity using a pretrained Inception classifier. Good models produce images that lead to confident predictions (low entropy per image) while covering many classes overall (high entropy across images)—higher is better.


## TODOs
- Extract the autoencoder from DiT based models for usage
- Design the architecture for a latent based JiT model, using the autoencoder from DiT. Run a short training on this model to make sure it can be used in combination with the JiT pixel based model.
- Design the bridge between pixel based JiT and Latent Based JiT model. Probably using bi directional cross attention between the two models.
